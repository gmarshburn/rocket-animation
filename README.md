# Overview
My cartoon shows the Falcon 9 rocket launching into space followed by the Dragon capsule splashing back down, 
just like my dad will launch next week and splash back down to earth in April. The cartoon has key input interaction, 
so that the left and right keys moves the stars in the background left and right, respectively, and the space bar makes 
the stars disappear and come back into view. There is also a functioning quit button and a label that continuously 
updates with the rocket's current altitude.

My cartoon contains a PaneOrganizer class to organizer each pane, a Cartoon class to set each object 
into motion, and two composite shape classes - one for the rocket that launches (and background in front of the Dragon) 
and one for the capsule that lands (and background behind the Dragon), which also handles key press interaction.
